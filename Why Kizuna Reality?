How many technologies must an enterprise monopolize
before Metaverse comes true?
How many potential possibilities must a commercial pattern puts away
before people taste its fruit?
Where there is a route, a route free from the avenue of competiton, there is a possibility to create something on our own.

The answer is among us.
We know it.
We fight what's bigger than us.
The MIRACLE of Kizuna AI, the first vtuber, will echo in the history of Metaverse technologies.
